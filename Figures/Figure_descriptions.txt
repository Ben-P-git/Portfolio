Model and data similarity density funciton: 
A scatter plot made up of a model and data showing the spatial relationship. I used Gaussian kernal density estiamtion to create the colour scale for the plot.

Time series of deformation:
A time series of each of the ground velocity of different deformation sources.

Density function:
A density function showing the sampling rate across a large interferogram.

Norm plots:
Model A: Heatmap of the average downsampled pixel count: comparing minimum variance, original pixel size, and pixel number. 
Model B: Plot of the Natural logarithm of the residual norm: quadtree vs original interferogram. The colour gradient representing the original pixel number.

Original sources:
Syntehtic velocity maps of different geological deformation sources.
